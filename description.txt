ATTENTION: It's not recommended to use it in combination with VapeRPG because it has this mod's functionality implemented in it already.

This mod adds qualities to items (in a World of Warcraft style). Keep in mind, that only accessories and armor can be qualified better than common (yet).

Qualities:
 Common: The default quality for any item.
 Uncommon: Provides minor bonuses to the player's stats. Min stats: 1, Max stats: 3, chance: 15%
 Rare: Provides better bonuses than Uncommon. Min stats: 2, Max Stats: 4, chance: 10%
 Epic: Provides the best bonuses for ordinary qualities. Min stats: 3, Max Stats: 5, chance: 5%
 Unique: Only some boss dropped items get this quality, stat bonuses are well paired here (no melee-magic combo, etc.).

Unique quality items are dropped from almost any boss. For now, these are only armor set pieces and can't be obtained any other way.
Bosses always drop one pieces of a set matching their tier. (for example, the Eye of Cthulhu drops Gold Armor pieces, all unique)
Reforging doesn't reroll the quality of the item. Once an item gets qualified, it cannot be changed.
